An event bot for rocketchat powered by functional clojure lang.

# Quickstart: (experimental)

1) create a `.rocketchat.edn` file in same dir of `fullrocketmetal jar` with following content:

```
{:credentials  {:username "myusername" :server-url "myserver-rocketchat-url.com" :token "my-token-rocketchat"}}
```

2) create a `event.edn` file in same dir of `fullrocketmetal` with following content:

```
{:reminders [
             {:channel-name "caasp-release-squad" :cron-schedule "" :message "[autogenerated] @here meeting in 5 min! GTM board here: https://app.gotomeeting.com/?meetingId=YOUR_NUMBER"},
             {:channel-name "caasp-feature-squad" :cron-schedule "0 0 15 ? * 5" :message "i'm just a text after the default message"},
             ]}
```

this will send to `channel-name` a `message` which is a reminder, and  you can specify the frequence of the message via `cron-schedule` which follow the crontab syntax.

3) run

## Devel:

`lein repl` in the project for using REPL.

`lein run` for running it
