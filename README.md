An event bot for rocketchat powered by functional clojure lang.

## Released versions:

for a released version, take a look at GitHub releases.

# Quickstart: (experimental)

## Configuration

Make sure this 2 edn files are in the same directory to the JAR clojure file you execute.

1) create a `.rocketchat.edn` file in same dir of `fullrocketmetal jar` with following content:

```
{:credentials  {:username "myusername" :server-url "myserver-rocketchat-url.com" :token "my-token-rocketchat"}}
```

2) create a `event.edn` file in same dir of `fullrocketmetal` with following content:

```
{:reminders [
             {:channel-name "caasp-release-squad" :cron-schedule "" :message "[autogenerated] @here meeting in 5 min! GTM board here: https://app.gotomeeting.com/?meetingId=YOUR_NUMBER"},
             {:channel-name "caasp-feature-squad" :cron-schedule "0 0 15 ? * 5" :message "i'm just a text after the default message"},
             ]}
```

this will send to `channel-name` a `message` which is a reminder, and  you can specify the frequence of the message via `cron-schedule` which follow the crontab syntax.

## Build from src

3) Use `lein uberjar` to build the jar

4) Use `java -jar fullrocketmetal-VERSION-standalone.jar`. This will run `fullrocketmetal` demo.


## Devel:

`lein repl` in the project for using REPL.

`lein run` for running it
